### Weather forecasting is the prediction of the state of the atmosphere for a given location using the application of science and technology. This includes temperature, rain, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. Weather warnings are a special kind of short-range forecast carried out for the protection of human life. Weather warnings are issued by the governments throughout the world for all kinds of threatening weather events including tropical storms and tropical cyclones depending upon the location. The forecast may be short-range or Long-range. 
### Usually I have used VS-code editor to create a user interface using ReactJS, HTML and CSS. For the background colours I have used RGB colour effect of Html tags. And for sunny, rainy, mist & cloudy I have used their images so that based on the region we search it will show the image above the temperature.
